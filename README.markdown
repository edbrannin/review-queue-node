# Review-queue app: Desktop version

Goals:

* Review apps in iTunes, tag as Keep/Review/Backlog/Delete
* Auto-tag by genre, author(?), age rating
* Filter by installed-on-iDevice
* Filter by tag
* Sort by size, name, dates
* Show Backlog items to review
* Show to-delete items to delete manually from iTunes
    * Eventually automatically delete from iTunes?
* Detect deleted & updated apps without tag-loss or duplication
* Save/restore app Documents & Preferences from a connected iOS device (Rquires ifuse)
